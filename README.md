# DataSciAssignment


eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the code and results of an analysis performed on an eCommerce Transactions dataset. The dataset includes customer information, product details, and transaction data. The analysis aims to uncover insights, build predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations to improve business strategies.

The tasks for this assignment are as follows:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Lookalike Model
Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Tasks Overview
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
Objective:
Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and key business insights.

Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf: A report summarizing the business insights.
FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook with the full EDA process, including visualizations and data transformations.
Task 2: Lookalike Model
Objective:
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a customer's information as input and recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.

Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv: A CSV file containing the top 3 similar customers (with similarity scores) for the first 20 customers in the dataset.
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook explaining the model development, feature engineering, and similarity score calculations.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Objective:
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on both customer profile and transaction data. Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index and visualizations.

Deliverables:
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf: A report with the clustering results, including the number of clusters, DB Index value, and other relevant metrics.
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for customer segmentation, clustering analysis, and visualizations.

Running the Jupyter Notebooks
To run the Jupyter Notebooks:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the repository is located.
Start Jupyter Notebook by typing the following command:
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open the respective .ipynb file (FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb, FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb, or FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb) and run each cell to execute the analysis.
CSV Files:
Make sure to place the Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv files in the same directory as the notebooks to ensure that they can be read correctly by the code.
