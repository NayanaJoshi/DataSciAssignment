# eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and results of an analysis performed on an eCommerce Transactions dataset. The dataset includes customer information, product details, and transaction data. The analysis aims to uncover insights, build predictive models, and provide actionable recommendations to improve business strategies.

The tasks for this assignment are as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights**
2. **Lookalike Model**
3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

#### Objective:
Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and key business insights.

#### Deliverables:
- **FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf**: A report summarizing the business insights.
- **FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook with the full EDA process, including visualizations and data transformations.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model

#### Objective:
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a customer's information as input and recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.

#### Deliverables:
- **FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv**: A CSV file containing the top 3 similar customers (with similarity scores) for the first 20 customers in the dataset.
- **FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook explaining the model development, feature engineering, and similarity score calculations.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

#### Objective:
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on both customer profile and transaction data. Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index and visualizations.

#### Deliverables:
- **FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf**: A report with the clustering results, including the number of clusters, DB Index value, and other relevant metrics.
- **FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for customer segmentation, clustering analysis, and visualizations.
